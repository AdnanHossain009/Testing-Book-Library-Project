- ðŸ”­ This is my first Android Project 

  <h1>Book Library </h1>
  <p>
        This Android application, built using Java in Android Studio, allows users to maintain a personalized library of books. 
        The app features a <strong>list of books</strong> with details such as the <strong>author</strong> and 
        <strong>number of pages</strong>. Users can click on any book to view more information on the <strong>book details page</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>On the details page, users have four interactive options:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Add to Favorites</li>
        <li>Add to Currently Reading</li>
        <li>Add to Already Read</li>
        <li>Add to Wishlist</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
        Once a book is added to one of these categories, users can navigate to the respective category pages to find their selections. 
        Additionally, users can <strong>delete books</strong> from these categories, providing a simple way to manage their library.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p> 
        This project offers an easy-to-use interface for organizing and tracking books, whether they are currently being read, already finished, or saved for future reading.
        Users can effortlessly categorize their books into sections such as "Currently Reading," "Already Read," and "Wishlist," making it simple to manage their reading habits. 
        The intuitive design allows for quick access to book details, including authors and page counts, enhancing the overall reading experience. 
        Additionally, the ability to add, remove, and update book entries ensures that users can keep their library up to date with minimal effort.
