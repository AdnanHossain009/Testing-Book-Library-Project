<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Adnan Hossain Utsaw</h1>

- ðŸ”­ This is my first Android Project 

  <h1>Book Library </h1>
  <p>
        This Android application, built using Java in Android Studio, allows users to maintain a personalized library of books. 
        The app features a <strong>list of books</strong> with details such as the <strong>author</strong> and 
        <strong>number of pages</strong>. Users can click on any book to view more information on the <strong>book details page</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>On the details page, users have four interactive options:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Add to Favorites</li>
        <li>Add to Currently Reading</li>
        <li>Add to Already Read</li>
        <li>Add to Wishlist</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
        Once a book is added to one of these categories, users can navigate to the respective category pages to find their selections. 
        Additionally, users can <strong>delete books</strong> from these categories, providing a simple way to manage their library.
  </p>

  <p>
        This project offers an easy-to-use interface for organizing and tracking books, whether they are currently being read, already 
        finished, or saved for future reading.
